The Cream Cake Company

About Us

We bake some of the best bread, cakes, pastries and tarts you are ever likely to taste. We are proud to be winners of the 'Best Cupcake Award' for three years running: 2014, 2015 & 2016. We love to innovate, and are always coming up with great new ideas. Although some of our products may not be traditional, we continue to use good old-fashioned methods in our bakery, ensuring that our delicious products are of the highest quality.

The Cream Cake Company began in 1997 as a family-run business based in Thornbury. We began baking our favourite bread products, cakes and pastries and selling them on Saturdays at nearby Preston Market. We soon found that demand for our delicious home-made products meant that we had to move to new premises, and we now work from a fantastic old bakery on Miller street. 

Great news!

We are delighted to announce that we've opened up a new cafe in Thornbury, where you can enjoy our bread, cakes and pastries along with a great cup of coffee from the Bean Alliance.
